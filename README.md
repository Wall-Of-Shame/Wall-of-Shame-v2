<h1 align="center">Wall of Shame</h1>

Can't seem to stop procrastinating? 🥲 Finding it hard to stop pressing that "Next Episode" button on Netflix? 🤫 Well, that's where Wall of Shame comes in. Your salvation.

Create your own challenges (can be absolutely anything) and grab a couple of friends to join your quest of completing them together! 🥳

Here's the catch. Anyone who fails the challenge before the deadline will be thrown to the Wall of Shame, where their name and reason for failure will be proudly displayed for everyone to see. 🤡 That's pretty good motivation, right?

Here are some other cool features:
  
- You can throw tomatoes and poop at people on the Wall of Shame 🍅💩
- Use powerups that can bend the rules of challenges (eg. protecc against shaming) ⚡️💪
